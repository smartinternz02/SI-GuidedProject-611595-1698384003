# SI-GuidedProject-611595-1698384003 - Tea Leaves Disease Detection

# Tea Leaves Disease Prediction using CNN

## Overview

This project aims to predict tea leaves diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It includes a web interface built with Flask for user interaction, and a Jupyter notebook (ipynb) for the model development. The dataset used for training and testing the model is also included.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: The `web_interface` directory contains the code for the Flask web application. Users can interact with the trained model through this interface.

- **Model Development**: The `Predicting_the_disease_in_tea_leaves.ipynb` notebook includes the code for developing and training the CNN model. It provides detailed explanations and visualizations of the model architecture and training process.

- **Dataset**: The `dataset.txt` directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and rights to use and distribute the dataset.
